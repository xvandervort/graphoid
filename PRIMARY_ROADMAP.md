# Glang Primary Development Roadmap
*Last Updated: January 2025*

## Mission Statement
Transform Glang from a practical programming language into a revolutionary platform for graph-based, self-aware computational systems.

## Current State (January 2025)
- **Version**: Pre-1.0 (Development Phase)
- **Test Coverage**: 70% 
- **Core Features**: Complete function system, type inference, collections, file loading
- **Architecture**: Container-based (lists, hashes, data nodes)
- **Production Readiness**: Not yet - needs standard library completion

## Development Phases

### ✅ Phase 0: Foundation (COMPLETED)
- AST-based execution system
- Type system with inference
- Functions and lambdas
- Basic collections (lists, hashes)
- File loading system
- REPL environment
- 70% test coverage

### 📍 Phase 1: Production Readiness (Q1-Q2 2025) - CURRENT
**Goal**: Make Glang practical for real-world applications

#### 1.1 Standard Library Completion
- [x] Math module with constants
- [x] JSON encoding/decoding
- [x] Complete I/O operations (file, network, console)
- [x] String manipulation utilities
- [x] Date/time handling (with precision integration and data node consistency)
- [ ] Regular expressions
- [ ] Random number generation

#### 1.2 Developer Experience
- [ ] Comprehensive error messages with stack traces
- [ ] Debugger support
- [ ] IDE integration (VS Code extension)
- [x] Package manager design (see PACKAGING_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md)
- [ ] Package manager implementation (glang-package command)
- [ ] Documentation generator

#### 1.3 Performance & Stability
- [ ] Performance benchmarking suite
- [ ] Memory leak detection
- [ ] Optimization pass on hot paths
- [ ] Achieve 85% test coverage

**Deliverables**: v0.9 release with standard library

### 🎯 Phase 2: Graph Foundation (Q3-Q4 2025)
**Goal**: Transform containers into true graph structures

> **See**: [ABSTRACTION_LAYER_ROADMAP.md](./ABSTRACTION_LAYER_ROADMAP.md) for detailed design

#### Key Features
- Edge implementation with metadata
- Node awareness (knows container and siblings)
- Graph traversal algorithms
- Path finding and connectivity analysis

**Deliverables**: v1.0 release with graph primitives

### 🔮 Phase 3: Self-Aware Systems (2026)
**Goal**: Enable self-understanding and self-modification

> **See**: [ABSTRACTION_LAYER_ROADMAP.md](./ABSTRACTION_LAYER_ROADMAP.md#phase-2-self-aware-data-structures-q3-2025)

#### Key Features
- Reflection API for structure introspection
- Method-data unification
- Controlled self-mutation with governance
- Evolution patterns and genetic algorithms

**Deliverables**: v1.5 release with self-aware features

### 🌐 Phase 4: Distributed Computing (2027)
**Goal**: Multi-machine graph systems

> **See**: [ABSTRACTION_LAYER_ROADMAP.md](./ABSTRACTION_LAYER_ROADMAP.md#phase-4-distributed-graph-systems-2026)

#### Key Features
- Distributed graph runtime
- Consensus mechanisms
- Network transparency
- Fault tolerance

**Deliverables**: v2.0 release with distributed capabilities

## Technical Debt & Improvements

### High Priority
1. **Module System Completion**: Finish implementing all planned standard library modules
2. **Error Handling**: Improve error messages and add stack traces
3. **Performance**: Profile and optimize critical paths

### Medium Priority  
1. **Documentation**: Complete language reference and tutorials
2. **Tooling**: Build debugger and profiler
3. **Platform Support**: Ensure Windows/Mac/Linux compatibility

### Low Priority (Philosophical Purity)
1. **Custom Number System**: Replace Python float/int with GlangNumber
2. **String Implementation**: Native string handling without Python strings
3. **Pure Glang Bootstrap**: Rewrite interpreter in Glang itself

## Success Criteria

### For v1.0 Release
- [ ] Can build a web service in pure Glang
- [ ] Performance within 10x of Python for common tasks
- [ ] Zero segfaults/crashes in production use
- [ ] Comprehensive standard library
- [ ] Active community of 100+ users

### For v2.0 Release  
- [ ] Self-modifying AI agents running in Glang
- [ ] Distributed applications with <100ms latency
- [ ] Academic papers published on graph computing model
- [ ] Industry adoption for specific use cases

## Resource Planning

### Current Team
- Core development (1 person)
- Community contributors (as available)

### Future Needs
- Graph theory expert (Phase 2)
- Distributed systems engineer (Phase 4)
- Technical writer for documentation
- Community manager

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Performance overhead** from graph abstraction → Mitigate with C extensions
- **Complexity explosion** in API → User testing and iterative design
- **Distributed consensus bugs** → Formal verification of protocols

### Market Risks
- **Limited adoption** → Focus on unique use cases (AI, simulation)
- **Competition** from established languages → Emphasize unique graph features
